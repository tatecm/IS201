                    <p>It was my freshman year of college and I had just returned from a 2 year full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the Central Coast of California. That first semester at BYU was hard and hit me like a brick wall. I didn't know you could legally give out that much homework. Thank goodness we had review sessions though before the test... oh wait, half of the material on the test wasn't in the review. </p> 
                    <p>Now, on a serious note, it was difficult to adjust. But I had made it through three-quarters of the year. Now I was preparing for finals. Well, one of my classes had a final project. We were supposed to create something to represent our first year at BYU. What could I do? I could print out all of my homework and tests and put them into one book. That would be a heavy project. I could show them x-rays of my neck that was permanently bent down from looking at my laptop for so long. No, it had to be something more creative.</p>
                    <p>I worked with my dad in custom cabinetry and so I figured I could make something out of wood that could represent my time. A cabinet? No, too much material. Maybe a little box? I have no idea what that would represent. A ring. That would be perfect </p>
                    <p>I came to my dad with the idea and he doubted the ability to make the ring with the tools that we had, but we put our minds together. As we began working on it, it started to take shape. Soon we had created something perfect. Our family loved it and began to ask for rings, I presented it in my class and had classmates asking me for a website or a place to buy these rings.</p>
                    <p>Well, here we are today.</p>
                    <p>And here's a quick video of my first semester at BYU:</p>
